# Carbon
A quick to use web framework which utilizes jade and scss for front end shenanigans.
This framework is designed to be as minimal and barebones as possible, yet powerful enough to be able to create dynamic web servers with ease.

## Why did I make this?
I used to use express, but the lack of secure servers disappointed me. I could have forked it and made that a possibility, but because it was a port of the express js framework, I didn't want to rear my ugly head into that.
Because of my previous experience with express, this framework uses a similar approach to handling routes and what not. Features are created as I need them.
